There is what could be considered an issue with the number of lines averaged adjustment. With the way it is currently implemented, 
it also dictates how many lines are averaged to find the offsets from zero. This means usually that the larger the number of 
lines averaged, the higher the offset is if there isn't a long enough period of rest at the start of each raw data file.
A higher offset means more shift for the accelerations.
Using the noise threshold does help this issue some, but the best solution is a second or so of rest at the beginning of each 
flight, that is until there is a change in how the average offset is calculated.
