LOG00003 is supposed to be an elevator ride from the bottom floor of the ET to the third floor. 
LOG00015 is supposed to be the hardware flipped over 180 degrees while held in the same position.
LOG00023 is supposed to be the hardware ran across the cave on a chair at high speed.
Units for velocity and acceleration are supposed to be meters/sec and meters/sec^2, but this seems to indicate severe accuracy
problems or that these are not the correct units.

Test graphs are from a hand created raw data file to show the relations between acceleration, velocity, and displacement.

'Non_Rotational'graphs have not been run through rotational matrices to take the gyroscope data into account. These graphs show a clear
drift created by the rotations because while the acceleration magnitudes are shifted, the offsets calculated early on are not. This
is a problem that needs addressed. Currently, it is either don't calibrate, which causes significant error, or don't fix the accelerations
based on the gyroscope which would render finding the initial position of a flight impossible. 

'Non-Rotate_No_Calibrate' is just the result of neither calibrating the data or shifting it though the rotational matices.
